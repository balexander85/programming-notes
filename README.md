## Introduction

This is my personal collection of technical setup guides and helpful notes related to programming. As I collate my thoughts and insights, this repository serves as a skeleton structure for organizing my programming-related notes.

## Contents

The repository currently covers a broad spectrum of programming-related subjects, including but not limited to:

* [aws](./aws/README.md)
  * [Setting up React website in AWS](./aws/ec2/README.md)
  * [Use an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve a static website](./aws/s3/README.md)

Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and more content will be added regularly as I continue to organize and expand my notes.
